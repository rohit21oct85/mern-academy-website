                        <p>
                        You may be asking what programming languages to learn if you want to work as a web developer. Not only that, but you'll want to know which languages to prioritise. Do you begin with the simplest? Or the ones that are the most useful? Both? Why study JavaScript these days, when there are so many options?

                        You've probably heard that JavaScript is an important online technology, but you're not sure if it's still relevant today. Is it really necessary to learn JavaScript from scratch when there are so many frameworks that provide ready-to-use code?

                        <p>
                        We'll look at what JavaScript does and if it's still helpful in this guide. After that, we'll go through some of the most compelling reasons to learn JavaScript, as well as why it's important to learn plain JavaScript first, before moving on to libraries and frameworks.

                        <h3>What is JavaScript and what does it do?</h3>
                        <p>It's critical to know exactly what something is and what it does before you begin learning it. This is very helpful when learning a new programming language.</p>
                        <p>JavaScript is a programming language that is used to create interactive websites. If you consider the core components of a website, you have HTML, which explains and specifies the website's basic content and structure, and CSS, which informs the browser how to display this HTML information, defining things like colour and font.</p>
