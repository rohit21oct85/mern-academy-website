            You may be asking what programming languages to learn if you want to
            work as a web developer. Not only that, but you'll want to know
            which languages to prioritise. Do you begin with the simplest? Or
            the ones that are the most useful? Both? Why study JavaScript these
            days, when there are so many options?
          </p>
          <p>
            You've probably heard that JavaScript is an important online
            technology, but you're not sure if it's still relevant today. Is it
            really necessary to learn JavaScript from scratch when there are so
            many frameworks that provide ready-to-use code?
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll look at what JavaScript does and if it's still helpful in this
            guide. After that, we'll go through some of the most compelling
            reasons to learn JavaScript, as well as why it's important to learn
            plain JavaScript first, before moving on to libraries and
            frameworks.
          </p>

          <h3>What is JavaScript and what does it do?</h3>
          <p>
            It's critical to know exactly what something is and what it does
            before you begin learning it. This is very helpful when learning a
            new programming language.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a programming language that is used to create
            interactive websites. If you consider the core components of a
            website, you have HTML, which explains and specifies the website's
            basic content and structure, and CSS, which informs the browser how
            to display this HTML information, defining things like colour and
            font.
          </p>

          <br />
          <br />
          <h3>JavaScript experts are versatile</h3>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a very flexible programming language. The
            possibilities are unlimited once you've learned it: you can use
            React Js to code on the client-side (frontend) and Node.js to code
            on the server-side (backend). You can also use React, React Native,
            and Electron to create web, mobile, and desktop apps, as well as get
            into machine learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript is required if you wish to work as a frontend developer.
            As a JS specialist, though, it isn't the only job option available
            to you. You might work in full-stack development, games development,
            information security software engineering, machine learning, and
            artificial intelligence after mastering this important programming
            language, to name a few!
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, if you want to work in development or engineering, you'll
            need to know JavaScript.
          </p>

          <br />
          <br />
          <h3>JavaScript experts are in-demand (and well-paid)</h3>
          <p>
            Because JavaScript is the most widely used programming language on
            the planet, it's no surprise that it's one of the most in-demand web
            development abilities today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Simultaneously, the global demand for the language appears to
            outnumber the available competence. According to a HackerRank
            research, 48 percent of firms worldwide want JavaScript engineers,
            while just 42% of student developers claim to be fluent in the
            language. And, according to HackerRank's most recent report for
            2020, the most popular language that hiring managers look for in a
            web development candidate is JavaScript.
          </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>Omni-platform</h3>
            <p>JavaScript can run everywhere, including:<br />
            Devices like mobiles, tablets, and laptops<br />
            On the client-side as well as the server-side<br />
            This ability to run everywhere makes JavaScript a universal language.
